//: Demo of deriving Pythagorean triples.
//:
//: Pythagorean triples are integer tuples (a, b, c) such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2).
//: They represent right-angled triangles with all sides having integer length in a given unit of measure.
//:
//: They form a tree with the root at (3, 4, 5), with each triple having 3 child triples.
//:
//: Per the Wikipedia page, the standard derivation is based on the formulae:
//:
//:     1. a = m^2 - n^2
//:     2. b = 2mn
//:     3. c = m^2 + n^2
//:     where m > n > 0 and one is always even, the other always odd.
//:
//: The next 3 values of m and n, corresponding to the 3 child triples of (3, 4, 5) are
//: derived by the following 3 formulae:
//:
//:     (m1, n1) = (2m - n, m)
//:     (m2, n2) = (2m + n, m)
//:     (m3, n3) = (m + 2n, n)
//:
//: So let's work out the 3 child triples of (3, 4, 5).
//# Purpose: Recreational, learning.
