# Example thag configuration with theme_dir setting
# This file demonstrates how to configure thag to use custom themes from a user directory
#
# To use this configuration:
# 1. Copy this file to ~/.config/thag/config.toml (or your platform's config directory)
# 2. Modify the theme_dir path to point to your custom themes directory
# 3. Place your .toml theme files in that directory
# 4. Use THAG_THEME=your-theme-name to select custom themes

[styling]
# Directory where your custom theme files are stored
# This can be overridden by the THAG_THEME_DIR environment variable
theme_dir = "/Users/username/.config/thag/themes"

# Optional: Set color support level (basic, color256, true_color, or leave for auto-detection)
# color_support = "true_color"

# Optional: Override terminal background detection
# term_bg_luma = "dark"  # or "light"
# term_bg_rgb = [40, 44, 52]  # RGB values if known

# Theme preferences for auto-detection (these work with both builtin and custom themes)
preferred_dark = ["my-custom-dark", "dracula", "nord"]
preferred_light = ["my-custom-light", "github", "one-light"]

# Fallback themes if preferred themes don't match
fallback_dark = ["basic_dark"]
fallback_light = ["basic_light"]

# Set default verbosity level
default_verbosity = "info"
