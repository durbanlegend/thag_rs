# Unicode Double Underline Character Options

## User

Could you suggest a good character for a double underline that is longer than "=" so as not to leave gaps?

I'll help you find a good character for double underlining that won't leave gaps. Let me look at some options for you.

When you want to create a double underline that's longer than "=", you have several Unicode characters that might work well. Let me suggest some options:

1. `━` (Box Drawing Heavy Horizontal) - This is a thick solid line that works well for underlining
2. `▬` (Black Rectangle) - This creates a solid bar that can be used for underlining
3. `✦✦✦` (Multiple Black Four Pointed Stars) - For a decorative underlining
4. `▁` or `▂` or `▃` (Block elements) - These provide different thickness options
5. `═` (Box Drawing Double Horizontal) - This is specifically a double line character

The Box Drawing Double Horizontal character `═` is specifically designed for double lines and should provide what you're looking for without leaving gaps. It's commonly used in terminal/console UI designs for this exact purpose.

Would you like me to show any examples of how these might look in use?
