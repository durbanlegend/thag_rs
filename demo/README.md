## Running the scripts

`thag_rs` uses `clap` for a standard command-line interface. Try `thag --help` (or -h) if
you get stuck.

### In its simplest form:


    thag <path to script>

###### E.g.:

    thag demo/hello.rs

### Passing options and arguments to a script:

Use `--` to separate options and arguments meant for the script from those meant for `thag` itself.

###### E.g.:

demo/fib_dashu_snippet.rs expects to be passed an integer _n_ and will compute the _nth_ number in the
Fibonacci sequence.

     thag demo/fib_dashu_snippet.rs -- 100

### Full syntax:

    thag [THAG OPTIONS] <path to script> [-- [SCRIPT OPTIONS] <script args>]

###### E.g.:

`demo/clap_tut_builder_01.rs` is a published example from the `clap` crate.
Its command-line signature looks like this:

    clap_tut_builder_01 [OPTIONS] [name] [COMMAND]

The arguments in their short form are:

    `-c <config_file>`      an optional configuration file
    `-d` / `-dd` / `ddd`    debug, at increasing levels of verbosity
    [name]                  an optional filename
    [COMMAND]               a command (e.g. test) to run

If we were to compile `clap_tut_builder_01` as an executable (`-x` option) and then run it, we might pass
it some parameters like this:

    clap_tut_builder_01 -dd -c my.cfg my_file test -l

and get output like this:

    Value for name: my_file
    Value for config: my.cfg
    Debug mode is on
    Printing testing lists...

Running the source from `thag` looks similar, we just replace `clap_tut_builder_01` by `thag demo/clap_tut_builder_01.rs --`:

*thag demo/clap_tut_builder_01.rs --* -dd -c my.cfg my_file test -l

Any parameters for `thag` should go before the `--`, e.g. we may choose use -qq to suppress `thag` messages:

    thag demo/clap_tut_builder_01.rs -qq -- -dd -c my.cfg my_file test -l

which will give identical output to the above.



##### Remember to use `--` to separate options and arguments that are intended for `thag` from those intended for the target script.

### Script: dethag_re.rs

**Description:**  Unescape \n and \\" markers in a string to convert the wall of text to readable lines.
 This version using regex may be more reliable than the classic approach using .lines().
 However, at time of writing, `regex` is a 248kB crate, which makes the binary of this
 module more than 5 time larger than that of `thagomizer`.

 Tip: Regex tested using https://rustexp.lpil.uk/.

**Purpose:** Useful script for converting a wall of text such as some TOML errors back into legible formatted messages.

**Crates:** `lazy_static`, `regex`

**Type:** Program

**Link:** [dethag_re.rs](https://github.com/durbanlegend/thag_rs/blob/master/demo/dethag_re.rs)

---

### Script: dethagomizer.rs

**Description:**  Unescape \n and \\" markers in a string to convert the wall of text to readable lines.
 This is trickier than it seems because in a compile-time literal, \n compiles to the
 true line feed character 10 (x0A), whereas a \n generated or captured as a literal
 at run time is encoded as ('\', 'n'() = (92, 110) = 0x5c6e. Not surprisingly, the two
 representations, while they look identical to the programmer, don't always behave
 the same.

 See `demo/dethagomizer.rs` for a Regex version.

**Purpose:** Useful script for converting a wall of text such as some TOML errors back into legible formatted messages.

**Type:** Program

---

### Script: duration_snippet.rs

**Description:**  Minimal snippet showing how to add nice additional constructors such as `from_weeks` (and days, hours and
 minutes) to `std::time::Duration`.

 These are enabled by adding the inner attribute `#![feature(duration_constructors)]` to the script.
 I've used a snippet to illustrate that this is possible: an inner attribute (i.e. an attribute prefixed
 with `#!` (`#![...]`)) must be placed at the top of the crate it applies to, so when wrapping the snippet
 in a fn main, thag_rs pulls any inner attributes out to the top of the program.

 Notice we also have a shebang so that this script may be run as `demo/duration_snippet.rs` with execute
 permission. The shebang must be on the very first line but coexists peacefulyl with the inner attribute.

 See tracking issue https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/120301 for the `Duration` constructor issue..

 E.g. `(*nix)`:

     chmod u+g demo/duration_snippet.rs      // Only required the first time of course
     demo/duration_snippet.rs -qq
     1209600s

 Or more concisely:

     f=demo/duration_snippet.rs && chmod u+g $f && $f -qq
     1209600s


**Purpose:** Demonstrate that some fairly subtle moves are possible even with the simplest of snippets.

 according to the terminal's detected colour support and light or dark theme.
 (Detection itself is not part of the demo).
 This approach was rejected as it is simpler to use a single large enum and
 use the `strum` crate's `EnumString` derive macro to select the required
 variant from a composite string of the colour support, theme and message level.

**Purpose:** Demo prototyping different solutions using AI to provide the sample implementations.

### Script: factorial_dashu_product.rs

**Description:**  Fast factorial algorithm with arbitrary precision and avoiding recursion.
 Closures and functions are effectively interchangeable here.

  Using the `std::iter::Product` trait - if implemented - is the most concise
 factorial implementation. `dashu` implements it, so it's straightforward to use.


**Purpose:** Demo snippet, `dashu` crate, factorial using `std::iter::Product` trait.

### Script: factorial_ibig.rs

**Description:**  Fast factorial algorithms with arbitrary precision and avoiding recursion.
 A version using `std::Iterator::fold` and one using `std::iter::Successors:successors`
 are executed and compared to ensure they agree before printing out the value.
 Closures and functions are effectively interchangeable here.

 `let foo = |args| -> T {};` is equivalent to `fn foo(args) -> T {}`

 See also `demo/factorial_ibig_product.rs` for yet another version where we implement
 the `std::iter::Product` trait on a wrapped `ibig::UBig` in order to use the
 otherwise most concise, simple and approach. A very similar cross-platform implementation
 without the need for such Product scaffolding (since `dashu` implements `Product`)
 is `demo/factorial_dashu_product.rs`. The fastest by far is `demo/factorial_main_rug_product.rs`
 backed by GNU libraries, but unfortunately it does not support the Windows MSVC, although it
 may be possible to get it working with MSYS2.

 Before running any benchmarks based on these scripts, don't forget that some of them
 only run one algorithm while others are slowed down by running and comparing two different
 algorithms.

**Purpose:** Demo snippets with functions and closures, `ibig` cross-platform big-number crate.

### Script: factorial_ibig_product.rs

**Description:**  Fast factorial algorithm with arbitrary precision and avoiding recursion.
 Closures and functions are effectively interchangeable here.

 Using the `std::iter::Product` trait - if implemented - is the most concise factorial
 implementation. Unfortunately, but unlike the `dashu` and `rug` crates, `ibig` does
 not implement the Product trait, so we have to wrap the `UBig`. Which of course
 is pretty verbose in the context of a snippet, but could be useful in an app.
 The implementation is thanks to GPT-4.

**Purpose:** Demo snippet, `ibig` crate, factorial using `std::iter::Product` trait, workaround for implementing an external trait on an external crate.

### Script: fib_4784969_cpp_ibig.rs

 digits. This contains 3 alternative algorithms to compare their speed, with `fibo_new`
 edging out `fibo` at this scale.

 E.g.: `thag_rs demo/fib_4784969_cpp_ibig.rs -- 4784969   // or any positive integer`

 The `rug` crate runs blindingly fast, but I for one found it very difficult to get this to compile.

 E.g.: `thag_rs demo/fib_4784969_cpp_ibig.rs -- 4784969   // or any positive integer`

### Script: fib_basic.rs

**Description:**  Fast non-recursive classic Fibonacci calculations for a specific value or an entire sequence.
 I can't recall the exact source, but see for example https://users.rust-lang.org/t/fibonacci-sequence-fun/77495
 for a variety of alternative approaches. The various Fibonacci scripts here in the demo
 directory also show a number of approaches. `demo/fib_basic_ibig.rs` shows the use of
 the `std::iter::Successors` iterator as well as removing the limitations of Rust
 primitives. Most of the other examples explore different strategies for rapid computation of
 large Fibonacci values, and hopefully demonstrate the usefulness of `thag_rs` as a tool
 for trying out and comparing new ideas.

 As the number of Fibonacci examples here shows, this took me down a Fibonacci rabbit hole.

### Script: fib_big_clap_rug.rs

**Description:**  Fast non-recursive Fibonacci series and individual calculation with big integers.

 See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence.
 F0 = 0, F1 = 1, Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1.

 The `fib_series` closure could equally be implemented as a function here,
 but closure is arguably easier as you don't have to know or figure out the
 exact return type (`impl Iterator<Item = Integer>` if you're wondering).

 Using `clap` here is complete overkill, but this is just a demo.
 On Linux you may need to install the m4 package.

**Purpose:** Demonstrate snippets, closures, `clap` builder and a fast non-recursive fibonacci algorithm using the `successors`.

### Script: fib_binet_astro_snippet.rs

 computing powers of a negative number since they may result in a complex
 number. Regardless, relying on approximations of irrational numbers lends
 itself to inaccuracy.

 Shout-out to the `expr!` macro of the `astro-float` crate, which reduces very
 complex representations back to familiar expressions.

### Script: fib_doubling_iterative_ibig.rs

**Description:**  Very fast non-recursive calculation of an individual Fibonacci number using the
 Fibonacci doubling identity. See also `demo/fib_doubling_recursive.rs` for the
 original recursive implementation and the back story.

 This version is derived from `demo/fib_doubling_recursive_ibig.rs` with the following
 changes:

 1. Instead of calculating the `Fi` values in descending order as soon as they are
 identified, add them to a list and then calculate them from the list in ascending
 order.

 2. The list tends to end up containing strings of 3 or more commonly 4 consecutive
 `i` values for which `Fi` must be calculated. For any `i` that is the 3rd or
 subsequent entry in such a consecutive run, that is, for which Fi-2 and Fi-1 have
 already been calculated, compute Fi cheaply as Fi-2 + Fi-1 instead of using the
 normal multiplication formula.

### Script: fib_doubling_no_memo_ibig_1.rs

**Description:**  Try a version based on reverse engineering the `fibo_new / fibo_new_work` functions of `demo/fib_4784969_cpp_ibig.rs`
 This approach passes the pair `Fn, Fn+1` `(a, b)` and applies some funky calculations. I'll pay my dues here by doing
 the derivation.

 This version uses immutable arguments to the `fib` method.

 Starting with the usual formulae used by doubling methods.
 For even indices:

     F2n  = 2Fn.Fn+1 - Fn^2

          = Fn(2Fn+1 - Fn).   // i.e. a(2b - a)

 For odd indices:

     F2n+1 = Fn^2 + Fn+1^2.

 To the odd-index case we apply Cassini's identity: Fn^2 = Fn-1.Fn+1 - (-1)^n:

     F2n+1 = Fn+1^2 + Fn^2 +

           = Fn+1^2 + Fn+1Fn-1 - (-1)^n          // since by Cassini Fn^2 = Fn-1.Fn+1 - (-1)^n

           = Fn+1^2 + Fn+1(Fn+1 - Fn) - (-1)^n   // substituting for Fn-1

           = 2Fn+1^2 - Fn.Fn+1 - (-1)^n

           = Fn+1(2Fn+1 - Fn) - (-1)^n           // i.e. b(2b - a) - (-1)^n

 If n is odd, then a = F2n+1 and b = 2Fn+2, so we must derive the latter:

     F2n+2 = F2m where m = n+1 = Fm(2Fm+1 - Fm)

           = Fn+1(2F(n+2) - Fn+1)

           = Fn+1(2Fn+1 + 2Fn - Fn+1)            // Since Fn+2 = Fn + Fn+1

           = Fn+1(Fn+1 + 2Fn)                    // i.e. b(b+2a)

     For even indices:

     F2n  = 2Fn.Fn+1 - Fn^2

          = Fn(2Fn+1 - Fn).   // i.e. a(2b - a)

     For odd indices:

     F2n+1 = Fn^2 + Fn+1^2.


 To the odd-index case we apply Cassini's identity: Fn^2 = Fn-1.Fn+1 - (-1)^n:

     F2n+1 = Fn+1^2 + Fn^2 +

           = Fn+1^2 + Fn+1Fn-1 - (-1)^n          // since by Cassini Fn^2 = Fn-1.Fn+1 - (-1)^n

           = Fn+1^2 + Fn+1(Fn+1 - Fn) - (-1)^n   // substituting for Fn-1

           = 2Fn+1^2 - Fn.Fn+1 - (-1)^n

           = Fn+1(2Fn+1 - Fn) - (-1)^n           // i.e. b(2b - a) - (-1)^n

 If n is odd, then a = F2n+1 and b = 2Fn+2, so we must derive the latter:

     F2n+2 = F2m where m = n+1 = Fm(2Fm+1 - Fm)

           = Fn+1(2F(n+2) - Fn+1)

           = Fn+1(2Fn+1 + 2Fn - Fn+1)            // Since Fn+2 = Fn + Fn+1

           = Fn+1(Fn+1 + 2Fn)                    // i.e. b(b+2a)

### Script: fib_doubling_recursive_ibig.rs

**Description:**  Very fast recursive calculation of an individual Fibonacci number using the
 Fibonacci doubling identity. See also `demo/fib_doubling_iterative.rs` and
 `demo/fib_doubling_iterative_purge.rs` for non-recursive variations.

 I'm sure this is old hat, but I stumbled across an apparent pattern in the
 Fibonacci sequence:
 `For m > n: Fm = Fn-1.Fm-n + Fn.Fm-n+1.`

 This has a special case when m = 2n or 2n+1, which not surprisingly turn out
 to be well-known "doubling identities". The related technique is known as
 "fast doubling".

 For even indices: `F2n = Fn x (Fn-1 + Fn+1)`.
 For odd indices: `F2n+1 = Fn^2 + Fn+1^2`.

 This allows us to compute a given Fibonacci number F2n or F2n+1 by recursively
 or indeed iteratively expressing it in terms of Fn-1, Fn and Fn+1, or any two
 of these since Fn+1 = Fn-1 + Fn.

 I suggested this to ChatGPT, as well as the idea of pre-computing and storing the
 first 10 or 100 Fibonacci numbers to save repeated recalculation. ChatGPT went
 one better by memoizing all computed numbers. As there is a great deal of repetition
 and fanning out of calls to fib(), the memoization drastically cuts down recursion.

### Script: fib_matrix_dashu.rs

**Description:**  Very fast recursive calculation of an individual Fibonacci number
 using the matrix squaring technique.
 This example is by courtesy of Gemini AI. For F100,000 this is the

 method, and about 10 times faster than the classic iteration. For
 F1,000,000 to F10,000,000 it's overtaken by the doubling method.
 These are not formal benchmarks and your mileage may vary. Besides,
 these are only demo scripts and come with no guarantees.

 Aside from the imports, this script is interchangeable with `demo/fib_matrix_ibig.rs`
 and performance on my setup was very similar. However, `dashu` is
 not confined to integers but also supports floating point and rational
 numbers.

### Script: py_thag.rs

**Description:**  Demo of deriving Pythagorean triples.

 Pythagorean triples are integer tuples (a, b, c) such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2).
 They represent right-angled triangles with all sides having integer length in a given unit of measure.

 They form a tree with the root at (3, 4, 5), with each triple having 3 child triples.

 Per the Wikipedia page, the standard derivation is based on the formulae:

     1. a = m^2 - n^2
     2. b = 2mn
     3. c = m^2 + n^2
     where m > n > 0 and one is always even, the other always odd.

 The next 3 values of m and n, corresponding to the 3 child triples of (3, 4, 5) are
 derived by the following 3 formulae:

     (m1, n1) = (2m - n, m)
     (m2, n2) = (2m + n, m)
     (m3, n3) = (m + 2n, n)

 So let's work out the 3 child triples of (3, 4, 5).

### Script: supports_color.rs

**Description:**  Demo of crate `supports-color` that `thag_rs` uses to detect the level of
 colour support of the terminal in use. I've added the `clear_screen` method

**Type:** Program

**Link:** [syn_dump_syntax.rs](https://github.com/durbanlegend/thag_rs/blob/master/demo/syn_dump_syntax.rs)

---

### Script: syn_quote.rs

**Description:**  Prototype of a simple partial expression evaluator. It solicits a Rust expression and embeds
 it in a `println!` statement for use in generated code.

 E.g.:
 ```
 Enter an expression (e.g., 2 + 3):
 5 + 8
 rust_code=println ! ("result={}" , 5 + 8) ;
 ```
 Fun fact: you can paste the output into any of the `expr`, `edit`, `repl` or `stdin`
 modes of `thag_rs`, or even into a .rs file, and it will print out the value of the
 expression (in this case 13). Or you can do the same with the input (5 + 8) and it
 will do the same because `thag_rs` will detect and evaluate an expression in
 essentially the same way as this script does.

**Purpose:** demo expression evaluation (excluding compilation and execution) using the `syn` and `quote` crates.
