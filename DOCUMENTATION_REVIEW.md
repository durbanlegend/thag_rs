## For Library Authors
If you're building on thag_rs infrastructure, thag_common provides:
- Verbosity controls
- Common result types
- Utility macros

See API documentation for details: [docs.rs/thag_common]
```

Brief because it's infrastructure, not user-facing.

### thag_proc_macros/README.md
**Status**: Missing  
**Priority**: Medium-Low

**Recommendation**: Create brief README

```markdown
# thag_proc_macros

Procedural macros for thag_rs and thag_profiler.

This crate provides:
- `#[profiled]` attribute for thag_profiler
- `#[enable_profiling]` attribute for thag_profiler
- Category enums for demo scripts
- Build-time utilities

**Note**: This is a proc-macro crate used by other thag crates.
Most users will not import this directly.

## For Contributors
- Proc macros are defined in src/lib.rs
- Each macro has its own module
- Test with RUSTFLAGS to see expansions

See contributing guide: [link]
```

Brief, primarily for contributors.

### demo/proc_macros/README.md

## Conclusion

The existing documentation for thag_rs shows substantial care and effort. The main README and thag_profiler README are particularly strong and demonstrate the passion and vision behind this project. 

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage
- Excellent narrative flow (especially thag_profiler)
- Good technical accuracy
- Appropriate tone - collegial and descriptive

**Key Opportunities**:
- Add visual examples to "show not tell" more
- Create brief READMEs for foundation crates
- Enhance cross-references between documents
- Add quick-start guides for new users
- Expand integration examples

**Recommended Priority**: Focus on the "Must Do Before Release" items (estimated 10 hours), which will bring all documentation to a solid release-ready state. The enhancement items can be tackled incrementally after release.

The documentation is already at a level that many projects never achieve. These recommendations are about taking it from "very good" to "exemplary" while preserving the authentic voice and vision that makes this project special.
