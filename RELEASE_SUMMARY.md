---

## Quick Overview

This release represents a major evolution of `thag_rs` from v0.1.9 to v0.2.0, introducing two significant new independent subcrates (`thag_styling` and `thag_profiler`) along with substantial enhancements to the core toolkit.

**What's Included**:
- Comprehensive release plan with step-by-step instructions
- Detailed documentation review with specific recommendations
- Coordinated publishing strategy for 6 crates
- Quality assurance checklist
- Timeline and effort estimates

**Key Documents**:
1. **RELEASE_PLAN.md** - Complete step-by-step release process
2. **DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW.md** - Comprehensive documentation assessment and recommendations

---

## Executive Summary

### The Challenge

This is a coordinated multi-crate release with complex dependencies:
- 6 crates to publish (thag_common, thag_proc_macros, thag_styling, thag_profiler, thag_rs, thag_demo)
- Dependency ordering requirements (crates.io validates dependencies at publish time)
- Need for comprehensive documentation across all crates
- Desire to maintain the project's authentic, collegial voice

### The Solution

A phased approach with clear dependency ordering, comprehensive pre-release checks, and detailed documentation review.

### Current State

**Code Quality**: ✓ Strong
- All crates build successfully
- Tests appear comprehensive
- Code follows consistent patterns

**Documentation Quality**: ✓✓ Very Strong
- Main README: Excellent, comprehensive
- thag_profiler README: Outstanding (1500+ lines, well-structured)
- thag_styling README: Good foundation, needs expansion
- thag_demo README: Clear and inviting
- Missing: READMEs for thag_common and thag_proc_macros

**Release Readiness**: 85% Complete
- Code: Ready
- Tests: Ready
- Documentation: Needs ~10 hours of focused work
- Infrastructure: Ready (cargo-dist configured)

## Recommended Path Forward

### Phase 1: Pre-Release (2-3 days)

**Day 1: Documentation (10 hours)**
```
Must Do:
✓ Create thag_common/README.md (brief, 30 min)

### Phase 2: Publishing (1 day with delays)

**Timeline: Allow full day for proper delays**

```
09:00 - Publish thag_common
09:15 - Publish thag_proc_macros (parallel with common)
