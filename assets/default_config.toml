#   quieter - Minimal output, suitable for piping to another process
#   quiet - Less detailed output
#   normal - Standard output level

# Terminal color settings
[colors]
# If your terminal can handle 16m colors, choose color256.
# The aliases are the legacy names.
# Available options for ColorSupport:
#   true_color - Full color support, 24 bits -> 16 million colors.
#   color256 (alias xterm256) - 256-color support, suitable for color palettes of 256 colours (16 bit).
#   basic (alias ansi16) - Basic 16-color support
#   none - No color support
#   undetermined - Still to be determined or defaulted

# Available options for TermTheme:
#   light - Light background terminal
#   dark - Dark background terminal (default)
#   auto_detect - Let `thag` autodetect the background luminosity

# Terminal light/dark override. Tells thag_rs whether you are using a light or dark theme,
# instead of letting thag_rs interrogate the terminal, which could cause misbehaviour
# on Windows in particular, or choose a default, which if incorrect could compromise the
# legibility of text.
# Valid values are: "dark" or "light".
# "dark" is generally a safe choice as the colors should be legible even for a light theme

# Demo proc macro settings

# Allows user to specify manifest directory paths for the thag_demo_proc_macro crate and the
# internal `bank` equivalent. This is a prerequisite for the `thag_rs` proc-macros feature.

# Specify a valid absolute or relative path string if required, e.g. "/Users/thag/projects/thag_rs/demo/proc_macros/Cargo.toml".
# Relative paths should be relative to the current working directory.
# A single forward slash is the required path separator in all environments including Windows.

# Default is "config". It has sensible settings built into the default config.toml for some popular crates.
