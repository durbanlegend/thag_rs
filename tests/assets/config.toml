# Demo proc macro settings

# Allows user to specify manifest directory paths for the thag_demo_proc_macro crate and the

# Specify a valid absolute or relative path string if required, e.g. "/Users/thag/projects/thag_rs/demo/proc_macros/Cargo.toml".
# Relative paths should be relative to the current working directory.
# A single forward slash is the required path separator in all environments including Windows.

# Miscellaneous configuration parameters
[misc]
# User's preferred text unquote behaviour. By default, thag_rs will not strip double quotes
# from text values returned by snippets. Setting this to true will override this behaviour.
# In turn, this user default may be overridden on the command line by specifying --unquote
# (-u) true/false (default true).
# This behaviour only applies to snippets that explicitly or implicitly return a string
# value. It does not affect well-formed programs or println! statements in snippets.
# Valid values are: "true" or "false" (default).
