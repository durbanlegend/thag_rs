/// Unescape \n and \\" markers in a string to convert the wall of text to readable lines.
/// This is trickier than it seems because in a compile-time literal, \n compiles to the
/// true line feed character 10 (x0A), whereas a \n generated or captured as a literal
/// at run time is encoded as ('\', 'n'() = (92, 110) = 0x5c6e. Not surprisingly, the two
/// representations, while they look identical to the programmer, don't always behave
/// the same.
///
/// See `demo/dethagomizer.rs` for a Regex version.
//# Purpose: Useful script for converting a wall of text such as some TOML errors back into legible formatted messages.
//# Categories: crates, technique, tools
