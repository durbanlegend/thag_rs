Interactive demos for `thag_rs` and `thag_profiler` - run Rust profiling examples without installing thag!

## Quick Start

**One-line demo experience:**

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durbanlegend/thag_rs/main/thag_demo/install_and_demo.sh | bash
```

**Or install manually:**

```bash
cargo install thag_demo
thag_demo --list
```

## What is thag_demo?

`thag_demo` is a lightweight facade over `thag_rs` that provides curated profiling examples and demonstrations. It's designed to let you explore the capabilities of `thag_profiler` without needing to install the full `thag_rs` toolkit.

*Click to watch: The demo shows running `thag_demo browse` to view all the `thag` scripts in $THAG_DEMO_DIR, and selecting and running the `ratatui` showcase demo. It also highlights the use of `thag_styling` integrations to automatically theme both the `inquire` selection list and the `ratatui` showcase screen with the current `catppuccin-mocha` theme.*

##### Detailed steps

 - Invoke thag_demo with the browse option.

 - Inquire crate displays themed scrollable list of thag demo scripts.

 - Type rata to narrow the search on the fly.

 - Arrow down to select ratatui_theming_showcase script.

 - Enter to invoke run options for the script.

 - Final Enter builds script if needed and runs it.

 - Demo shows `ratatui` showcase app, themed by thag_styling with the terminal - ‚Äôs current catppuccin-mocha theme, as specified by $THAG_THEME.

 - Show 1st panel of app with progress bar responding to keys or mouse.  - Dashed border effect in some areas is an artefact of the video player.

 - Show pop-up help.

 - Show remaining 3 panels in turn.

 - Enter q to return to thag_demo browse.

 - Esc to end thag_demo browse.

### üìã List All Scripts
```bash
thag_demo list-scripts
```
See all available demo scripts with descriptions and categories.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Demo Directory Management
```bash
thag_demo manage
```
Download, update, or manage the demo script collection.

### üìù Custom Scripts
```bash
thag_demo script <script_name>
```
Run any script from the thag_rs demo collection.

## How It Works

`thag_demo` is a thin wrapper around `thag_rs` that:

1. **Bundles curated examples** - High-quality profiling demonstrations
2. **Manages demo collection** - Automatically downloads 330+ demo scripts
3. **Provides interactive browsing** - Filter and search through demos by name/category
4. **Configures thag_rs** - Pre-configured for optimal demo experience
5. **Provides guidance** - Explains what each demo teaches
6. **Generates artifacts** - Creates flamegraphs and profile data you can explore

### Demo Directory Discovery

The tool automatically searches for demo scripts in multiple locations:

- Sibling to thag_demo installation

- `~/.thag/demo` (standard user location)

- `$THAG_DEMO_DIR` environment variable

- `./demo` in current directory

If not found, it offers to download the demo collection using `thag_get_demo_dir`.

## Interactive Commands

### Browse Demos Interactively
```bash
thag_demo browse
```
- Filter demos by typing part of the name
- Navigate with arrow keys
- See descriptions and categories inline
- Run demos directly from the browser

### Manage Demo Directory
```bash
thag_demo manage
```
- Download the demo collection if not present
- Update existing demo collection
- View directory information and statistics
- Browse demos interactively

### List All Available Scripts
```bash
thag_demo list-scripts
```
- Shows both built-in demos and script demos
- Displays descriptions and categories
- Provides usage examples

## Requirements

- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Internet connection (for demo directory download)
- Git (for downloading demo collection)

## Output Files

Each demo generates several files you can explore:

- `*.svg` - Interactive flamegraphs (open in browser)
- `*.folded` - Raw profile data for analysis
- Console output with explanations and tips

## Integration with thag_profiler

All demos use `thag_profiler` annotations:

```rust
use thag_profiler::{enable_profiling, profiled};

#[profiled]
fn my_function() {
    // Your code here
}

#[enable_profiling(time)]
fn main() {
    my_function();
}
```

## Next Steps

After running the demos:

1. **Explore the flamegraphs** - Open the `.svg` files in your browser
2. **Try thag_profiler** - Add profiling to your own projects
3. **Use thag_rs** - Install the full toolkit for script development
4. **Read the docs** - Check out the full documentation
