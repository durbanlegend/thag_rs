/// Prototype of detecting the light or dark theme in use, and registering it
/// as a static enum value for use in message style selection. Example of using
/// an LLM to generate a prototype to a simple spec. The `clear_screen` function
/// was added manually later. This prototype is one of many that was incorporated
