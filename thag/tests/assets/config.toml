# Color support override. Sets the terminal's color support level. The alternative is
# to leave it up to thag, which depending on the platform may call 3rd-party crates
# to interrogate the terminal, which could cause misbehaviour, or may choose a default,
# which might not take advantage of the full capabilities of the terminal.
# If the terminal can't handle your chosen level, this may cause unwanted control strings
# to be interleaved with the messages.
# If your terminal can handle 16m colors, choose xterm256
# Available options for ColorSupport:
#   xterm256 - Full color support, suitable for color palettes of 256 colours (16 bit) or higher.
#   ansi16 - Basic 16-color support
#   none - No color support
#   auto_detect - Auto-detect from terminal
# color_support = "ansi16"

# Terminal light/dark override. Tells thag whether you are using a light or dark theme,
# instead of letting thag interrogate the terminal, which could cause misbehaviour
# on Windows in particular, or choose a default, which if incorrect could compromise the
# legibility of text.
# Valid values are: "dark" or "light".
# "dark" is generally a safe choice as the colors should be legible even for a light theme

# Relative paths should be relative to the current working directory.
# A single forward slash is the required path separator in all environments including Windows.

# User's preferred text unquote behaviour. By default, thag will not strip double quotes
# from text values returned by snippets. Setting this to true will override this behaviour.
# In turn, this user default may be overridden on the command line by specifying --unquote
# (-u) true/false (default true).
# This behaviour only applies to snippets that explicitly or implicitly return a string
# value. It does not affect well-formed programs or println! statements in snippets.
# Valid values are: "true" or "false" (default).
